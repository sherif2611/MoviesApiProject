I have developed a robust ASP.NET Core Web API leveraging a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and efficiency.

Here's a brief overview:

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

ASP.NET Identity (User, Role): For managing user roles and authentication.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): To secure API endpoints.

Generic Repository and Unit of Work: For clean and maintainable code.

AutoMapper: For object-to-object mapping.

Dependency Injection: To promote loosely coupled design and enhance testability.

ðŸ”¹ API Features:
